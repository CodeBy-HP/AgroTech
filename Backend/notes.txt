We are developing a platform that connects farmers and businesses for raw material procurement.
importance of project (Prevent farm waste during disasters by connecting desperate farmers with bulk buyers in real-time., Prevent farm waste during disasters by connecting desperate farmers with bulk buyers in real-time. Struggle to get fair prices, unaware of government schemes, and lack data to plan crops for future demand.,Governments: Lack real-time data to design effective farmer schemes.,Companies: Waste time/money sourcing raw materials, no visibility into crop quality/timelines.)

Core Tech Stack ( already have a template)
Backend: FastAPI (Python)
Frontend: Next.js 
Database: SQlite
Authentication: OAuth2 & JWT
More Tech for UI and all sort of things later -

Our Solution
 1. Crop Disease Awareness Alert (Rule-Based + External API)
How it works: Based on current weather conditions and crop type, alert farmers about potential diseases (e.g., ‚ÄúHigh risk of blight for potatoes due to humidity‚Äù).

Integration Plan:

Use a public API like OpenWeatherMap or Weatherstack for current conditions.

Add a rule-based engine in the backend (e.g., if crop == wheat and humidity > 70, raise alert).

Show alerts on the Farm Detail Page or Farmer Dashboard.

üìà 2. Price Forecasting for Crops (Dashboard-only AI)
How it works: Fetch historical and predicted prices from a source like Quandl, Agmarknet, or use dummy ML logic.

Integration Plan:

Create a backend route /api/forecast/prices/ which returns weekly/monthly predictions.

Display as graphs on the dashboard, not farm-specific ‚Äî keeps UI light and generic.

üß† 3. AI-based Crop Suggestion System
How it works: Suggest crops based on location, soil type, and current season.

Integration Plan:

Create a form or use existing farm data (like area, location, past crops).

Backend runs a simple model (or hardcoded logic + data from ICAR or APIs).

Show recommended crops when farmer adds or edits a farm.

‚òÄÔ∏è 4. Weather Prediction
How it works: Show a 7-day weather forecast for the farm location.

Integration Plan:

Use OpenWeatherMap 7-day forecast API.

Display on Farm Detail Page or Dashboard with minimal UI (cards or charts).

üèõÔ∏è 5. Govt Scheme Suggester
How it works: Suggest government schemes based on user type, location, and crop.

Integration Plan:

Hardcode scheme eligibility logic or scrape from PM-Kisan or MyGov.

Add a section on the dashboard or profile with recommendations.
