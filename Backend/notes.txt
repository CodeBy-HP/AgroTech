We are developing a platform that connects farmers and businesses for raw material procurement.
importance of project (Prevent farm waste during disasters by connecting desperate farmers with bulk buyers in real-time., Prevent farm waste during disasters by connecting desperate farmers with bulk buyers in real-time. Struggle to get fair prices, unaware of government schemes, and lack data to plan crops for future demand.,Governments: Lack real-time data to design effective farmer schemes.,Companies: Waste time/money sourcing raw materials, no visibility into crop quality/timelines.)

Core Tech Stack ( already have a template)
Backend: FastAPI (Python)
Frontend: Next.js 
Database: SQlite
Authentication: OAuth2 & JWT
More Tech for UI and all sort of things later -

Our Solution
B2B platform that:
first important feature(to focus now) -> Connects farmers directly to companies for fair price deals, farmers could search there needed raw material on our website and then we will list the farmers that are looking for buyers to make UI nice we can show the farmers on a nice UI map where company can see the eligible farm lands . when comapany click the farmland we will show full information of the farmland like farmer name, farmland area, crop type , soil type, organic or not, expected harvesting date, contact etc. then company could place a deal for the farmer.

other features -> Uses predictive analytics to advise farmers on what to plant for maximum profit.
other features -> Auto-matches farmers to government schemes they qualify for.
